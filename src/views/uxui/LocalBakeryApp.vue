      Coffee Shop & Bakery UX Case Study: Streamlining Orders & Expanding
      Business
    </h1>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Problem Statement & Research</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> The local Filipino coffee shop in my
        neighborhood is very popular with working people, but they experience
        long queues in the morning, which leads to delays. I designed this app
        to allow customers to preorder or get their coffee and pastries
        delivered, helping reduce wait times and expand the business.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Research:</strong> I observed the morning rush at the coffee
        shop and interviewed several customers and staff to understand the
        impact of long queues. I also analyzed existing apps in the food service
        industry that offer preordering and delivery to identify best practices
        and areas for improvement. The shop already has a strong brand identity,
        which I incorporated into the app design for consistency.

      <h2>2. User Goals & Needs</h2>
      <div class="personas-container">
        <div class="persona">
          <h3>Persona 1: James Anderson</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> 34</li>
            <li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Marketing Manager</li>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Nearby office complex</li>
            <li><strong>Tech Proficiency:</strong> High</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Background:</strong> James works in a fast-paced office
            nearby and grabs coffee and a pastry from the shop every morning.
            Due to his busy schedule, waiting in long lines is a hassle, and he
            often ends up late for work meetings.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Goals:</strong> James wants to quickly place an order in
            advance and pick it up on his way to work without waiting in line.
            He also enjoys trying different pastries and would love the ability
            to easily view daily specials through the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Frustrations:</strong> The long queues in the morning make
            it difficult for James to get his coffee quickly, and he often
            misses out on popular items that sell out before he reaches the
            counter.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="persona">
          <h3>Persona 2: Maria Lopez</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> 27</li>
            <li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Freelance Graphic Designer</li>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Lives locally</li>
            <li><strong>Tech Proficiency:</strong> Medium</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Background:</strong> Maria works from home and loves
            supporting local businesses. She frequently orders coffee and
            pastries for delivery to enjoy during her workday. Maria is also a
            fan of the coffee shop’s merchandise, which she often buys for
            herself or as gifts.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Goals:</strong> Maria wants an easy way to order delivery or
            preorder for pickup when she’s out running errands. She also wants
            to browse and purchase merchandise through the app, taking advantage
            of exclusive online offers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Frustrations:</strong> Delivery times can be unpredictable,
            and Maria wishes she could track her orders through the app. She
            also finds it inconvenient to go to the shop to buy merchandise in
            person.

      <h2>3. Ideation & Brainstorming</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Idea Generation:</strong> I brainstormed several solutions to
        streamline the coffee shop’s morning rush. My main ideas were allowing
        users to preorder their coffee and pastries for quick pickup and
        providing a delivery option. I also wanted to integrate the shop’s
        merchandise, allowing customers to purchase directly through the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Feature Prioritization:</strong> The MVP includes preorder
        functionality, delivery tracking, and a shop for purchasing merchandise.
        Other potential features, like loyalty rewards or mobile payments, were
        deprioritized for future iterations to focus on the core user needs.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Wireframing & Prototyping</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Low-Fidelity Wireframes:</strong> I started by sketching the
        core user flow: selecting items for preorder or delivery, making the
        payment, and receiving an order confirmation. I designed simple,
        intuitive navigation to ensure users could quickly access these
        features.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>High-Fidelity Prototypes:</strong> I developed high-fidelity
        prototypes using the coffee shop’s existing brand identity. The color
        scheme and typography were carried over from the shop’s branding, and I
        designed visually appealing product displays for their pastries and
        merchandise. The app also featured a clean order summary page and a
        tracking system for deliveries.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. User Testing & Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Usability Testing:</strong> I tested the app with six users,
        including regular customers and new users. The testing focused on the
        preorder flow, delivery tracking, and product browsing. The main
        feedback was that users wanted clearer icons for delivery and pickup
        options and more prominent notifications for order updates.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Iterations Based on Feedback:</strong> Based on the feedback, I
        made changes to the icons and added push notifications for order
        statuses (e.g., order confirmed, ready for pickup, or out for delivery).
        I also optimized the delivery tracking map to display estimated times
        more clearly.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Visual Design & Branding</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Brand Identity:</strong> The app’s visual design reflects the
        shop’s existing brand identity, which includes warm, earthy tones and
        playful typography. I ensured that the app maintained consistency with
        the physical store’s ambiance, using the same logo, colors, and
        typography to create a cohesive experience for customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Emotional Design:</strong> The goal was to make the app feel
        personal and welcoming, much like the coffee shop itself. I used imagery
        of the shop’s best-selling pastries and coffee to entice users and evoke
        the cozy, friendly atmosphere that customers love.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Final Prototype & User Flow</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Interactive Flow:</strong> The final prototype allows users to
        quickly browse the menu, select items for preorder or delivery, and
        track their order status. Customers can also explore the shop’s
        merchandise, place orders, and receive notifications when their items
        are ready for pickup or out for delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example User Flow:</strong> A customer opens the app, selects
        their favorite coffee and a pastry for pickup, chooses a time for
        pickup, and pays online. They receive a notification when their order is
        ready, allowing them to skip the line and collect their order quickly.
        They can also browse the merchandise section and add an item to their
        cart for delivery alongside their coffee order.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Impact:</strong> The app reduces queue times during peak hours,
        increases customer satisfaction by offering convenient preorder and
        delivery options, and expands the shop’s reach by selling merchandise
        online.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Reflection & Next Steps</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Reflection:</strong> This project helped me understand how
        digital solutions can streamline small business operations and enhance
        the customer experience. Designing the app around the coffee shop’s
        existing brand identity allowed me to create a consistent, familiar user
        experience that reflects the shop’s values.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Next Steps:</strong> In the future, I would like to implement a
        loyalty program to encourage repeat customers and integrate mobile
        payments to speed up the checkout process. Additionally, adding
        real-time delivery tracking and order customization options would
        further enhance the user experience.
